# Wind Turbines (Redux)

This mod adds multiple tiers of wind turbines that turn with the wind (in up to 32 steps) and will provide power (configurable base). You can choose whenever it should provide power at a fixed rate or vary wind speed. In order to balance them against solars they do have a rather big footprint and need to have some distance betweem them. You can fill that space with other stuff though.

This version is a redux of the original by Ownly Me. In comparison to Wind Turbines 2 by majuss it should properly limit power production and it also features configurable base power from Wind Turbines 2 Configurable Power by ethanatos.

The latter also feature support for WindSpeedChanging. This mod detects its presence and will let it to do its thing if it's detected. If you are playing with varying wind speed enabled and WindSpeedChanging is not detected this mod will vary wind speed on its own.
