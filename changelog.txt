0.18.11
- After re-measuring the length of the blades, your engineers have come to the conclusion that it's safe to build the turbines 3 tiles closer to each other.
- You lost some weight and can now fit between a (squeak-through) solar panel and a wind turbine

0.17.10
- Slightly de-randomized the wind speeds and removed hard caps

0.17.9
- Removed 2 debug messages

0.17.8
- Fixed top and base not blending seamlessly

0.17.7
- The mod now randomizes the surface's wind speeds between 0.011 and 0.035 (before it was locked on 0.02)
- The wind speed determines the animation speed and power output (up to 52% more power than declared, but might also produce 52% less power)
- Added a startup-setting to make the wind- and animation speed not affect power output

0.17.5
- Fixed an error when a wind turbine got script-removed
- Improved performance with huge wind parks

0.17.4
- Hidden some of the entities from the map view

0.17.3
- Added some safety checks to prevent crashes

0.17.2
- Made all sub-entities indestructible to prevent crashes with "fire department"
